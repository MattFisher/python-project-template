# python-project-template

A [Copier](https://copier.readthedocs.io/) template for MattFisher's Python
projects, plus the shared reusable CI workflow they all call. It encodes one
standard so the repos don't drift:

- **uv** for dependency management (`uv sync`, `uv run`), pinned Python via
  `.python-version`
- **hatchling** build backend for libraries; apps stay `package = false`
- **pre-commit** stack: ruff (lint + format), [zizmor](https://docs.zizmor.sh/)
  (Actions security), mdformat, optionally typos — plus **mypy** (always) and
  **pytest**
- Shared **`python-ci`** reusable workflow (`uv sync` → mypy → pytest →
  pre-commit), so every repo's CI is a three-line caller
- Optional TypeScript/JavaScript side: **Biome** (lint + format) in the
  pre-commit stack, plus a shared **`node-ci`** workflow for type-check and
  build
- **Keep a Changelog** `CHANGELOG.md`; libraries also get PyPI trusted
  publishing (`publish.yml` + `RELEASING.md`)
- A Claude Code `SessionStart` hook that pre-warms the toolchain. With a
  frontend it also points corepack at `registry.npmjs.org`, since some sandbox
  egress proxies block `repo.yarnpkg.com` and corepack then fails before Yarn or
  pnpm starts — which leaves the frontend impossible to install, build or
  type-check. Plain npm ignores the setting.

## Scaffold a new project

```bash
uvx copier copy gh:MattFisher/python-project-template my-new-project
```

You'll be asked for the name, description, whether it's an app or a library,
Python version, whether to enable a coverage gate, whether the project has a
TypeScript/JavaScript frontend, whether to run the typos spell-checker, and
whether to open template-update PRs automatically.

### Turning off `typos`

Answer no to `use_typos` and the hook is left out of the generated
`.pre-commit-config.yaml`. Worth doing for projects whose vocabulary the
checker doesn't know — medical, legal or scientific terms, non-English proper
nouns — or that commit generated data such as serialised fixtures and
extraction output.

Note the hook is configured **report-only**, with `args: [--force-exclude]`.
Its own defaults are `[--write-changes, --force-exclude]`, which edit files
rather than reporting: on the wrong corpus that means silent, incorrect
rewrites. In one repo it renamed `Miliary` (as in miliary tuberculosis) to
`Military`, `PASH` to `HASH`, and every `...Ser` serializer class to `...Set`,
alongside ~900 edits inside hex digests — all committed before anyone noticed.
A spelling correction should need a human to approve it, so the template drops
`--write-changes`. Add it back per-project if you want the autofix.

## Update an existing project when the template changes

From inside a project that was generated from this template (it has a
`.copier-answers.yml`):

```bash
uvx copier update
```

Copier does a 3-way merge between the old template output, the new output, and
your local edits — so you get template improvements without losing your
customizations.

## The reusable CI workflow

Generated projects call
[`.github/workflows/python-ci.yml`](.github/workflows/python-ci.yml) rather than
duplicating CI. To bump CI for every repo at once, change it here and move the
`v1` tag.

```yaml
jobs:
  ci:
    uses: MattFisher/python-project-template/.github/workflows/python-ci.yml@v1
    with:
      python-version: "3.12"
```

### The TypeScript side

Answer yes to `use_frontend` and the scaffold also gets `biome.json`, a Biome
hook in the pre-commit stack, and a second CI job calling
[`node-ci.yml`](.github/workflows/node-ci.yml):

```yaml
  frontend:
    uses: MattFisher/python-project-template/.github/workflows/node-ci.yml@v1
    with:
      working-directory: "frontend"
```

`working-directory` is the point of the input: it defaults to the repo root
for a standalone package, and takes a subdirectory for a hybrid repo (a Django
app at the root with a Vite frontend under `frontend/`). `node-ci` also accepts
`node-version`, `package-manager` (yarn/npm/pnpm — it runs `corepack enable`,
so Yarn Berry and pnpm pin themselves through `packageManager` in
package.json), and `run-build`.

Note what `node-ci` does *not* do: lint and format. Biome runs as a pre-commit
hook, and `python-ci` already runs the whole pre-commit stack, so a hybrid repo
gets TS lint/format without paying for a second Node job. `node-ci` covers only
the parts that need the project's own dependencies installed.

`biome.json` excludes `.yarn`. Yarn Berry projects commit `.yarn/sdks` and
`.yarn/releases` (their `.gitignore` un-ignores them), so `useIgnoreFile`
alone doesn't keep Biome out of Yarn's own vendored code — without the
exclusion it reformats those files. Add your own exclusions there for any
generated data the project commits, such as serialised test fixtures.

Two smaller details in the generated config. The rule preset is spelled
`"preset": "recommended"` rather than `"recommended": true`, which Biome 2.5.5
deprecates. And a frontend scaffold excludes `tsconfig*.json` from the
`check-json` pre-commit hook: TypeScript has always allowed comments in
tsconfig, and Biome parses it as JSONC, but `check-json` uses Python's stdlib
`json` module and fails on them.

Biome is chosen for the same reason as ruff on the Python side — one fast Rust
binary doing both jobs, one config file, no plugin ecosystem to keep in sync.

Biome v2 added [type-aware
linting](https://biomejs.dev/blog/biome-v2/) using its own inference, so the
rules that used to require typescript-eslint no longer do. `noFloatingPromises`
works without a `tsconfig` or a type-checker in the loop — verified against
2.5.5. Those rules are still in the `nursery` group, so they aren't on by
default and have to be named:

```json
"linter": { "rules": { "nursery": { "noFloatingPromises": "error" } } }
```

The template leaves them off: nursery rules are explicitly unstable and may
change between releases. Turn them on per-project when you want them, and keep
`tsc --noEmit` under `strict` as the backstop either way — Biome's inference is
newer and less complete than a full type-checker's.

## Keeping projects up to date

Answer yes to `use_template_update` (the default) and the scaffold gets a
`template-update.yml` workflow that runs `copier update` weekly (and on demand)
and opens a PR when the template's *scaffolded files* have changed. Copier does
a three-way merge between the old template output, the new output, and the
project's local edits, so customisations survive.

Answering no leaves the workflow out. It does **not** cut the project off from
template updates: `.copier-answers.yml` is written either way, so
`uvx copier update` still works by hand whenever you want it. Worth declining
for a repo that should pull template changes on its own schedule rather than
weekly — one in a release freeze, or one whose local edits have diverged far
enough that every update run conflicts and the PRs become noise.

Two things worth knowing about the scope:

- **Reusable workflow changes need no update run.** Consumers pin
  `python-ci.yml@v1` and `node-ci.yml@v1`, so moving the `v1` tag propagates
  those immediately. The update workflow exists only for the copied files —
  `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, `biome.json`, `pyproject.toml` and friends.
- **It requires `.copier-answers.yml`.** A project adapted by hand rather than
  scaffolded has no baseline for copier to merge from, and the workflow fails
  with a message saying so. Adopt the template properly first.

Where copier's merge conflicts it leaves ordinary conflict markers and labels
the PR. Setting `resolve-conflicts-with-claude: true` (plus an
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` secret) has the Claude Code action attempt them instead.
It's off by default: copier's merge is deterministic and usually clean, and a
conflict is often exactly the thing a human should look at.

One GitHub quirk the PR body also mentions: it's opened with the default
`GITHUB_TOKEN`, and GitHub deliberately does not run workflows on PRs created
that way. Close and reopen the PR, or push a commit to it, to get CI to run —
or swap in a PAT or GitHub App token if you want that automatic.

## Versioning

Tagged `v1.0.0` with a moving `v1`. Generated projects pin the reusable workflow
to `@v1`; a repo-local `.github/zizmor.yml` allows tag-pinned refs from
`MattFisher/*` while still requiring commit-SHA pins for third-party actions.

The generated `.github/dependabot.yml` also ignores `MattFisher/*` for the
github-actions ecosystem. Without it, Dependabot rewrites `@v1` to a fixed
`@v1.x.y` and then opens a bump PR on every release — and the next `copier
update` restores the moving tag, so the two fight indefinitely. Third-party
actions are unaffected: still SHA-pinned, still bumped weekly.
