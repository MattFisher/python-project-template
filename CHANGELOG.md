### Added

- Initial template: TypeScript Worker scaffold with named wrangler

  `[env.staging]`), optional D1/R2/cron support, vitest-pool-workers tests
  that apply real D1 migrations, reusable `worker-ci.yml` and
  `worker-deploy.yml` workflows, the shared pre-commit stack (Biome, zizmor,
  actionlint, mdformat, optional typos), and copier template-update
  machinery.
